            This course has really tested my skills as an aspiring programmer because this is the first time I have taken
            a university level course. I especially had issues doing the C lectures because the language is very pedantic
            (as the instructor Mr. Malan suggests), for I have to specify things such as how much memory each variable can
            have. Furthermore, I also had to learn new topics such as hash tables and implement them, which I had not experienced
            in the past two years that I had taken programming courses. However, the course has gotten easier after I completed
            the C lectures, but they are still quite difficult. For instance, I had a couple of problems with the Python DNA pset
            because it forced me to go out of my comfort zone with that language. I generally have enjoyed the problems where I can
            clearly see an application to the real world. For instance, some of my favorites include this pset 8, pset 5's spell checker problem,
            and pset4's photo filter problems because I could directly see how my work applied to my daily life and for the first time
            I coudl visualize how these filters were built and actually end up creating them myself. Obviously, the videos by Mr. Yu have been
            incredibly helpful in breaking down these complex problems and are a big reason why I still manage to succeed in this course.
            Overall, this course has pushed me far past my programming limit, and I love it. It is a shame that is ending so quickly, but I know
            that this course will be helpful long after I complete it because of the skills it has taught me, not just in the realm of computing
            but also just general life lessons.
