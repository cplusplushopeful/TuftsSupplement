                Community goals
            </h1>
            <p>
            As I am a junior in high school, by next year I will be gone from my high school and entering university.
            I am not sure how much of an impact I can have on my community then because I will have a lot of work then
            (although when there is a will there is a way). Therefore, I want to make sure in my final years that I make
            as much of a difference I can in my local and global community. To this goal, I feel like I have stepped up
            well. Right now, I am pursuing many different routes to engage my community. I am currently in charge of a
            cultural event that spans the entire nation. This event is expected to rake in around $30,000. Furthermore,
            I am also participating avidly in local chapter fundraisers. For instance, I connected with a local homeless shelter
            and worked with a local pizza chain to bring them around 20 pizzas. I am aiming to be the Youth National Director for
            the nonprofit I work at, but there is no guarantee that I will get the position.

            <h1>
                Programming goals
            </h1>
            <p>
                After this CS50 course, I plan to pursue my own project and submit it to my local Congressman for the Congressional app
                award. This is because I feel that if I am able to achieve this, my application as a CS student will become much more
                serious and more career opportunities will start to open up. This is a very ambitious goal, but I have confidence that
                I have the ability to achieve it as well as in my plan to get to that point.
                I already have an app in mind, one that I have started working on for a different competition (called Jacobs competition
                hosted by the University of San Diego, where I have to present a pitch for an app). Essentially, this app will connect
                high school graduates with high school students and give students a platform to get advice from their seniors to improve
                their own chances of getting into colleges without having to aggressively network with other people (with varying degrees of success).
                Furthermore, this is a way for me to get back to the college counselling industry (a highly lucrative industry) which earns billions
                of dollars upon the insecurity of students. I want to even out the playing field a little more to enable those who don't have as much
                access to these sources because of their background and allow them to achieve the success they desire.

                Academic goals
            </h1>
            <p>
                Next year, every single one of my courses will either be APs or IBs (the hardest level my school offers). The expectation for me
                is to make sure that I maintain a high GPA and increase my rank in my school. Not much to say here, as the goals are relatively
                simple and straightforward.
