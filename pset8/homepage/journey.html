                This was the first year that I started programming. I started by taking a virtual school course called
                Foundations of Programming from FLVS (Florida Virtual School). I was introduced to a lot of basic
                Python syntax as well as programming conventions (which are useful to this day). However, the CS50
                course easily surpassed my knowledge of the programming language.

                This year, I took my first programmming course in my school. The name of the course was AP Computer Science
                Principles. We primarily used a website called code.org to learn Javascript (the language we learned in that class),
                and this course gave me insight on how to design and create apps and not just do smaller tasks that I was used to doing
                in my foundations of programming class. I also took another course online called Procedural Programming, but I did not learn
                much from this course.

                I started CS50 this year, and I started a new programming course at my school (AP Computer Science A).
                It was a challenging year because I faced a higher level of programming problems with more challenging
                syntax to memorize.
